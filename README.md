## About this repository

This repository serves to me publish some of the books scripts, most of them by **Seitz** recommendation I will write it a million times until get the code in my muscular memory.

Most of the scripts is quick-and-dirty as serves to the purpose of offensive cybersecurity.

For each chapter I will try to write a resume by mind, and after that review It.
